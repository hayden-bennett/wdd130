            <P>Washington States resides in what is known as the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The PNW is full of mountains, trees, lakes, rivers... basically everything and outdoor adventurer loves. Unique to washington is an aray of volcanoes, one famously known is Mount St. Helens that errupted in 1980. One unique fact is that Washington State holds the only temperate rainforest on the continent. Contrary to popular belief, it does not rain year long in Washington. While the East side of the Cascades receives much more rain than the East, the East side of Washington is very dry.</P>
